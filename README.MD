# **Wave Algorithm**

Shortest path in the maze, I decided this task with the help of the wave algorithm

You can enter any maze and you see shortest way, if maze have it.
### INPUT DATA:
  - Maze's walls mast be full
  - Way's point must be only 2

#### Designations:
- '#' - this is wall
- ' ' - this is space
- '*' - that point start or finish
